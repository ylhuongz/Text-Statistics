This program takes a plain text as input and creates a report that includes words, sentences, letters, and punctuation sign counts. It also allows users to search for words/sentences with a filter that supports options like "start with", "ends with", and "contains" returning a count of the occurrences and selecting the found words/sentences appending the results to the generated report.
