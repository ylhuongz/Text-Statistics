While lithium batteries are very popular and great for many uses, it is also fragile and requires a protection circuit to keep it safe for usage. Without this, energy stored in the battery will release all at once which causes the battery to explode. Short circuiting cause the plastic separator fails and lets the anode and cathode touch which leads to overheating and then explosion.
